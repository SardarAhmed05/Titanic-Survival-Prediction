# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and fare.  

The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not based on the available features.

---

## Features
The dataset includes the following key features:

- **PassengerId** – Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass** – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name, Sex, Age** – Personal details
- **SibSp, Parch** – Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard
- **Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked** – Ticket and travel details

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model selection: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
